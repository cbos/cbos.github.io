conference:
  name: ING Reliability Event
  location: Amsterdam
  date: September 23th, 2024
talk:
  title: Insights based on traces
  abstract:
    During the presentation I showed what insights you can get based on traces, span metrics and service graph metrics. 
    I developed a Grafana plugin called Application Observability which helps to get insights.
  
    And during the talk I showed what might come next, based on attributes like 'service.version' and also what will be possible when trace metrics become available.
