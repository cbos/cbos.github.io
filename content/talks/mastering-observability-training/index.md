    title: Mastering Application Insights - a Comprehensive Observability Training
    abstract:
        Have you ever wondered what is going on in your application at runtime? Where is the latency coming from? How much heap is being used under load? 
        Are you hitting your thread limits? How long does it take to query the database? What is the request flow between all your services? 
        What is the latency of all services for a slow request? How can you find the cause of this slowness?
        
        Many more questions can be answered if you made your application observable. If you want to know how to reach that and what you can learn from these new insights, register for this workshop.
