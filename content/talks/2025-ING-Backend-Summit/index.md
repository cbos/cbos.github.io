  title: Find your way to the right trace
  abstract:
    Customer impact is reported since 5 minutes, you see an error spike in your metrics, but what is causing this? Is it related to requests to downstream services? Or do we face other problems? Do we face these problems on all endpoints or just a single endpoint? Is it related to a specific country or specific customer journey?   
    The replacement for the old tracing UI has been live for about a year now, but time moves on, and Application and Chain Observability evolves too.   
    In a presentation and live demo I will show how to use this plugin in Grafana to get to the right traces and explain how to perform more advanced queries to obtain the necessary information.   
    
    What if you could enrich the spans so that you could better understand the context of the requests, and query them too? This could help you analyse the impact of new changes to your application or provide more answers in the event of outages.
    In the demo, I will show you how to improve the observability of your application.
